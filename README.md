Tracking NBA teams that draft or sign the best young talent 

In any sport, most long-term competitive or mini dynasty teams are built on the backs of young talent.[1] In this analysis, we are primarily interested in tracking which NBA front offices struck gold in terms of drafting or trading for players early on in their careers over 2000-2018 (under age 25).

The first NBA franchise that pops up on our list is the New Orleans franchise (both Hornets and now Pelicans). Way back in 2005, New Orleans drafted Chris Paul (78.3 career VORP) and later in 2012 Anthony Davis, who is now among the elite cluster of players in today’s game. Both Paul and Davis carried middling New Orleans teams into the playoffs.

Outside of the French Quarter, franchises including Oklahoma City, Orlando, and Atlanta have also established strong track records of landing young talent averaging 0.88 VORP/season for players under 25 shattering the NBA average 0.48 VORP since 2000.[2]

Most notably, the Thunders’ GM Sam Presti drafted landed Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, and James Harden in a two- year window propelling them into perpetual playoff contention and a 2012 NBA finals appearance against LeBron James and the Miami Heat. The Magic front office should also be lauded for finding young talent like Dwight Howard, Victor Oladipo, and Aaron Gordon. The latter two picks have strung together multiple elite level seasons.
